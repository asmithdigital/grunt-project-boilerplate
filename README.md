Grunt Scss boilerplate
=====================

You can either clone this repo or download the zip. If you clone it then remember to update your origin URL to the actual project you are working on, otherwise you will push to this repo and thats not what you want. 

*Remember to ensure you have the .gitignore file. It is hidden and you will only see it in the command line or text editor.*

**Install Node plugins:**
``` npm install ```

**Install Bower dependencies:**
``` bower install ```

**Build gulp project:**
``` grunt ```

**Watch for changes in JS and SCSS:**
``` grunt watch ```
